# Vane's Books Tracker ðŸ¤“ðŸ“š

Practice project in order to learn how to implement an image upload option using **Cloudinary**.
This app will help me keep track of the books I've read throughout this year.
It is a basic form built with React, which will create a new "Book" instance when submitted and then show a complete list of books including the recently added one.

## Backend
I have also developed the Backend for this application which consists of an **API built with Node.js and Express** and with data collected via **MongoDB and mongoose**.

You can find the repository for it here: https://github.com/VanessaSue27/books-tracker-backend
